# Approach
    I started with the ERD of Dungeon Master, Adventure and Player with the plan on doing a reach goal of adding Encounter and Monster. For each model, I created the GET route for each page then styled the page as I went. Some problems I ran into were that occasional the POST and PUT route of nested models would throw an error of " cannot run method remove of null". This was a hangup for a few minutes with a refresh of the page solving the issue. I still have no clue on why that issue arose.

# Version 2.0
    In further iterations I would love to make this a full functioning Dungeon Master app with links to Dungeon and Dragon APIs. Within that app the Dungeon Master could track the hit points of a particular monster or player, Determine and indicate if a player or monster is dead, Track initiative for players and monsters, read story points and instructions from the adventure and encounters, and indicate if an encounter is completed.
